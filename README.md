## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) can sometimes amplify the inherent biases and unfairness in users' inputs. Previous research
has shown the effectiveness of prompt engineering in making LLMs generate desired outputs. Our capstone project aims to
use Knowledge-Infused Learning approaches to reduce the biases and unfairness generated by Llama 2 from Meta. We proposed
the Distilled Knowledge Graph (KG) Infusion method and others, and evaluated their improvements in mitigating gender bias
in multiple Sephora cosmetic products. We presented an end-to-end pipeline of Distilled KG method, and further proposed
a framework to fine-tune LLaMA model toward this task.

#### Examples of LLaMA biased/unbiased outputs:

## Installation
1. Install [required packages](requirements.txt).  
   Please DO NOT simply use `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Instead, install
   [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) according to your configurations.
3. Visit [Llama 2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) site to register for the access to LLaMA model.
4. Register for HuggingFace using the __same__ email account as you register LLaMA and apply for an access token
   [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
5. Write the access token to your global environment and follow the instructions on
   [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama).
